# Dev Browser

A CLI for controlling browsers with sandboxed JavaScript scripts.

## Usage

Run `dev-browser --help` to learn more.

## Writing Tests

When the user asks to **write a test**, **create a test**, or **automate and save** a flow,
ALWAYS do both:

1. Write and run the dev-browser script using the `recording` API so interactions are captured.
2. Save the generated Playwright `.spec.ts` file to disk.

**Template:**
```javascript
const testName = "Login flow";
const outputFile = "login.spec.ts";

recording.start({ testName, outputFile });
const page = await browser.getPage("main");
const rPage = recording.wrap(page);

await rPage.goto("https://example.com/login");
// ... interactions using rPage instead of page ...

await recording.checkpoint("Logged in", rPage);
const result = await recording.stop();
console.log("Playwright test saved to:", result.filePath);
console.log(result.code);
```

**Rules:**
- Use `rPage` (wrapped page) for all interactions, not the raw `page`.
- Add `recording.checkpoint()` at key navigation steps (after login, after form submit, etc.).
- Always pass `outputFile` to `recording.start()` so the `.spec.ts` is written to disk.
- Choose a descriptive filename matching the flow, e.g. `checkout.spec.ts`, `auth-login.spec.ts`.
